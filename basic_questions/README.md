## Getting Started

1. Each program is self-contained in its respective `.c` file
2. Compile using a C compiler (gcc recommended):
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./filename
   ```

## Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming concepts
